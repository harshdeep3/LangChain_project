# LangChain_project
This project is used to learn how Langchain work. This will be a End to End project using Langchain

The idea for this project is to compare to paper on self supervised learning. One paper is "A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations" it can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709#). Seconds paper is "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

Paper 1 is presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. Paper 2 introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Both these papers are on Self supervised learn, or can be read to learn about self supervised. The aim of this project is to take these papers as input (unstructured data) extract information and convert to structure data. The structure data will then be passed into a LLM chain which will summarise the paper and compare the papers.
